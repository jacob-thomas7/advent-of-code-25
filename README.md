# Advent of Code 2025
My Rust implementations of the 2025 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## Usage
```bash
aoc25 <DAY> [-d --disable <OPTIONS>...]
```
The tool will run four tests for the day specified, aligning with the Advent of Code tests: "Example 1," "Puzzle 1," "Example 2," and "Puzzle 2."
Any one of these tests may be skipped either through the `--disable` option or by not providing the test file. Test files are located in "challenge_files";
the examples will read from "challenge_files/examples/day{}.txt", and puzzles from "challenge_files/puzzles/day{}.txt", where "{}" will be replaced with
the day being tested.

## Nutrition Facts
* 40 g Puzzles (78% DV)
* 34 g Rust (89% DV)
* 17 g Debugging (38% DV)
* 14 g Data Structures (12% DV)
* 13 mg Unsafe Rust (24% DV)

All solutions come from algorithms not treated with AI growth horomone*.

\*The BCA (Borrow Checking Agency) has determined that some significant difference has been shown between AI-treated algorithms and non-AI treated algorithms.
